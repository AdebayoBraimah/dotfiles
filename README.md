# Adebayo's dotfiles
Configuration files for linux and MacOS -- heavily inspired by [geerlingguy's dotfiles](https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles). The above dotfiles are mainly intended for Mac OS, but are flexible enough to work on some linux operating systems.

These dotfiles are mostly for the configuration of a (new) Mac via [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com). Additional instructions to perform a Mac setup and configuration can be found at geerlingguy's [Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook).
